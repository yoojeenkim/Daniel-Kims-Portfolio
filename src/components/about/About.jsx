                    <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Kim. I specialise in creating beautiful, usable, professional websites using best practice and the latest W3C web standards guidelines. All my sites are lovingly hand coded.</p>
                    <p>For building websites, my weapons of choice are React and Javascript to produce clean semantic HTML and CSS. I also use different libraries for handling animations and other features.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not in front of my comptuer, you'll find me either playing sports, going on hikes, practicing the guitar, or spending time with my family and friends! I love to travel, and I love web development!</p>
